# Bun experiments

This repo contains some experiment and benchmarks of newly released
[Bun](https://bun.sh/), which is a fast JavaScript all-in-one toolkit.

## Subdirectories

- `bun`: A directory containing some Bun pieces of code.
- `vanilla-react`: A vanilla React app created by `create-react-app`.
  - Currently `bun run build` doesn't work on my machine. Maybe this is due to
    the fact that I'm using `wsl`?
- `react-ts-template-for-bun`: A React app created by 
  `bun create itsanji/react-ts-template-for-bun` from
  [this template](https://github.com/itsanji/react-ts-template-for-bun).
  - Currently I can't run it because run script is missing in the template.
